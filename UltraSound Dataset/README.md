### Data Description
A large dataset of routinely acquired maternal-fetal screening ultrasound images collected from two different hospitals by several operators and ultrasound machines. All images were manually labeled by an expert maternal fetal clinician (B.V-A.). Images were divided into 6 classes: four of the most widely used fetal anatomical planes (Abdomen, Brain, Femur and Thorax), the mother’s cervix (widely used for prematurity screening) and a general category to include any other less common image plane. Fetal brain images were further categorized into the 3 most common fetal brain planes (Trans-thalamic, Trans-cerebellum, Trans-ventricular) to judge fine grain categorization performance. The final dataset is comprised of over 12,400 images from 1,792 patients. 

Images are in `./Images/*.png`

All information related with the images is in `FETAL_PLANES_DB_data` (provided both in csv and xlsx formats)

The dataset details are described in our open-acces paper: [Evaluation of deep convolutional neural networks for automatic classification of common maternal fetal ultrasound planes](https://rdcu.be/b47NX)
